# BlockmanGO Android Game Server

A custom Android game server implementation for **BlockmanGO**, focused on multiplayer networking, packet handling, and server-side game logic.

This project aims to provide a clean, scalable, and research-driven server environment for BlockmanGO, with an emphasis on performance, protocol correctness, and maintainable architecture.

---

## Overview

**BlockmanGO Android Game Server** is a standalone server-side implementation designed to handle client connections, gameplay synchronization, and core multiplayer features for BlockmanGO on Android.

The project is built from the ground up with a strong focus on:

* Multiplayer networking
* Packet serialization and deserialization
* Session and player management
* Game state synchronization
* Server performance and stability

The server is intended for **development, testing, learning, and experimentation purposes**.

---

## Key Features

* Custom Android-compatible game server
* Multiplayer networking with low-latency communication
* Structured packet system (C2S / S2C)
* Player session and connection management
* Game state and world synchronization
* Modular and extensible architecture
* Designed for scalability and future expansion

---

## Architecture

The server follows a modular design to keep components cleanly separated and easy to maintain:

* **Networking Layer** – Handles client connections, transport, and message routing
* **Protocol Layer** – Manages packet definitions and serialization
* **Game Logic Layer** – Processes gameplay rules and server-side decisions
* **Session Management** – Tracks connected players and active sessions
* **Utilities & Core Systems** – Logging, configuration, and helpers

This separation allows individual components to evolve independently and simplifies future feature additions.

## Development Status

🚧 **Active Development**

* Core networking and protocol handling: **In progress**
* Login and handshake flow: **Implemented / Improving**
* Gameplay synchronization: **Partial**
* Stability and performance tuning: **Ongoing**

The project is continuously evolving as new systems and improvements are added.

## Source Code Availability

🔒 **Source Code: Closed (for now)**

At the current stage, the source code is **not publicly available**.

The project may be **open-sourced in the future** once the architecture, stability, and internal APIs reach a more mature state.

Updates regarding source availability will be shared in this repository.

---

## Intended Use

This project is intended for:

* Server-side development experimentation
* Multiplayer networking research
* Protocol and packet analysis
* Educational and learning purposes
* Personal and private testing environments

It is **not intended for commercial use**.

---

## Disclaimer

This project is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to BlockmanGO or its developers**.

All implementations are created independently and are intended strictly for educational and research purposes.

---

## Future Plans

* Improve protocol compatibility
* Expand gameplay logic support
* Enhance server performance and stability
* Add configuration and plugin systems
* Public documentation for protocol and architecture
* Possible open-source release
